## Documentation scope

This documentation is centered on opening the local UI, understanding the interface, configuring accounts, placing manual trades, and using AI plus automation features.

It does not cover:

- Exchange adapter internals.
- Packaging script implementation details for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Website back-office, analytics dashboards, or internal admin logic.

If you are a normal user, you can skip the API section at first. Only go to [API Appendix (Advanced)](reference/api.md) when you need scripting, integration, or secondary development.
