3. For the IP field, only enter a whitelist if you really have a fixed IP environment such as a server. If you normally work behind changing residential IPs or VPNs, do not lock the key to an unstable address.
4. Grant trading permission only. Do not enable withdrawal permission. Complete the required 2FA or email verification to finish the creation.
